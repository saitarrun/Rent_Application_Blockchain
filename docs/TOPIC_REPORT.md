3. Why This Topic

Renting property today involves paperwork, deposits, delayed settlements, and disputes. Blockchain can automate agreement issuance, escrow deposits with transparent rules, and streamline recurring rent flows. Our project demonstrates practical value beyond a toy example while touching multiple course pillars (NFT, DeFi, micropayments, security).

4. Short Description

Rental Suite tokenizes each lease as a soulbound NFT that stores the parties and term. Tenants lock a security deposit in a DeFi escrow contract, and landlords can claim during the term subject to policy. Recurring payments are handled via a unidirectional rent channel using EIP‑712 vouchers. A polished Next.js frontend integrates MetaMask on Ganache/Sepolia and includes animated UI/UX. The stack uses Solidity 0.8.24, OpenZeppelin v5, Wagmi/Viem, and Hardhat/Truffle for deployment.
